This is MySQL to rabbitMQ replication / consumer service. The idea is to replicate all 
Row events to rabbitMQ.

The replcator replicates a MySQL master database to a given rabbitMQ instance

The consumer package reads from a given rabbitMQ instance and then pushes that to
a given MySQL slave. The consumers can push to multiple slaves if needed.
